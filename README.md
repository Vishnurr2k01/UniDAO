#uniDAO

Presently the decision making power in an institution is centralized and lies at the hands of a
few individuals . More than often these decisions are affected by a personal bias and are not
rational and transparent in nature. This mostly leads to dissatisfaction among people who are at the receiving
end of those decisions.Decentralized Autonomous Organisations, being an important element of Web3, have the privilege of solving this by decentralizing decision making by involving everyone by incorporating native or crypto tokens. This is unachievable for organizations without tokens ,having no means to scale up into higher levels of technology.Our aim is to introduce transparency, decentralization and distribution in every organizations by giving everyone the chance to involve in the decision making process through polls. What distinguishes UniDAO from other native DAOs is its unique poll process wherein each individual's vote is weighed according to their positional power in the organisation and not according to shareholder tokens.UniDAO achieves decentralization by the use of separate DAO's for user/Admin enrollment/disenrollment and addding new proposals, thus the name UniDAO.
